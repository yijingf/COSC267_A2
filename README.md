# COSC267 A2

Built a partially functioning front-end of an iOS app with Swift to introduce various Gundams, the mobile suit (robot) from animation TV series. The following functions were realized:
* A home screen that navigates to the list view, and two empty pages.
* Dynamically generate a scrolling list of Gundam models that users can tap to see the detail about a specific model
* Allows users to flag the Gundam models they like on the detail page, and filter a list of their favorites.
